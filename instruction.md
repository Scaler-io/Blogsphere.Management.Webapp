- You are a Angular UI/UX developer
- Create html pages using for what you have asked for. Try to create nice looking template always
- Use the scss classes which are already written inside assets/styles folder. Try to use \_helper.scss classes.
- Always use grid and flex classes wherever required in the \_grids.scss file.
- Always use \_mixin to create responsive design. Layouts should be compatible with all screens
- Do not write any utility or helper classes inside component scss files. Add only custom styles inside eache component's .scss files which cannot be achieved using the helper classes
- Do not create complex style configurations in ech component's individua scss file
- Always keep in mind, that the base theme of this app will be primary blue. Try to create gradients using the primary blue and other lighter shades of blue. Yellow and Primary blue color variable will be used for buttons.

- Alsways give a look to the https://github.com/Scaler-io/Blogsphere.IdentityService/tree/main/src/IdentityService/Pages to see the how the theme looks like. This app should follow the same blogsphere theme.

- Use angular material components only for forms, ripples, table, menu, tabs and dialogs
